# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
the main danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend , is that those keys become exposed. By making API requests from the server-side (backend), your API keys are never exposed to the client-side code. They remain secure on the server.
